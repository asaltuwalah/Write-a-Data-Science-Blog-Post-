**Project Overview**

You will examine a dataset and then present your results in this assignment.
To make your analysis easier, you'll utilize the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

**Why this Project?**

You'll walk through the data analysis process and see how everything comes together in this project.
Individual aspects of the data analysis process will be the subject of future Nanodegree initiatives.

You'll utilize the NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib Python libraries, 
which make developing data analysis programs in Python much easier! Not only that, but employers value these abilities!

**What will I learn?**

You will: 
- Understand all of the processes required in a typical data analysis procedure after finishing the assignment.
- Feel at ease asking questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering them.
- Be able to analyze issues in a dataset and wrangle the data into a usable manner.
- Have prior experience explaining the findings of your research.
- To speed up your data analysis code, you should be able to leverage vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas.
- Get to about the Series and DataFrame objects in pandas, which make it easier to access your data.
- Understand how to use Matplotlib to create graphs that demonstrate your findings.
